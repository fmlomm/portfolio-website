        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> 
        I graduated from Pittsburg High School in 2017, and found myself working after but I never really felt fufilled in what I was doing.
        My initial step into software engineering was actually a friend that reccommended that I look it since it 
        seemed that would be right up my alley. After completing Andrei Neagoie's Zero to Mastery, I wasn't fully satisfied with 
        my current knowledge and decided to enroll here to further master my skills. Outside of software engineering, I enjoy reading 
        various manga and building computers / mechanical keyboards.</p>
